This data is used as pat of a submission for the class getting and cleaning data, the purpose of this assignment is to  demonstrate your ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. 
The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. This piece of code will use the  data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone
and create a tidy data set to use.

What it does:
  1. Download and decompresses the data from https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip
  2. Bring the different data sets in to R including
      Features
      Training Data Set - Subjec_train, X_train and y_train
      Test data set - x test, y activity and subject test
  3. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
  4. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
  5. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
  6. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
  7. Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
