This repository is an assignmnet for the Coursera Course "Getting and Cleaning Data". The process creates an R Script that does:
  1. Download and decompresses the data from https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip
  2. Bring the different data sets in to R including
      Features
      Training Data Set - Subjec_train, X_train and y_train
      Test data set - x test, y activity and subject test
  3. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
  4. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
  5. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
  6. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
  7. Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
  
The data set was secured from http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones.

Standard Deviation and Mean Calculation:
  mean_std.select <- grep('mean|std', features)
  
Renamed the variables:
  nameNew <- names(data.sub)
  nameNew <- gsub("[(][)]", "", nameNew)
  nameNew <- gsub("^t", "TimeDomain_",nameNew)
  nameNew <- gsub("^f", "FrequencyDomain_", nameNew)
  nameNew <- gsub("Acc", "Accelerometer", nameNew)
  nameNew <- gsub("Gyro", "Gyroscope",nameNew)
  nameNew <- gsub("Mag", "Magnitude", nameNew)
  nameNew<- gsub("-mean-", "_Mean_", nameNew)
  nameNew <- gsub("-std-", "_StandardDeviation_", nameNew)
  nameNew <- gsub("-", "_", nameNew)
  #Set the names to be the string forma
